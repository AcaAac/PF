## Lab 1: Digital Signal Processing

### Description

This lab focuses on digital signal processing tasks. It involved exercises conducted via Google Forms that required analyzing and processing audio signals. The lab folder contains only the audio files used for the exercises.

### Contents

- `audio_files/`: Contains the audio files used in the lab exercises.

## Lab 2: Language Identification

### Description

This lab involves spoken language identification, which classifies the original language of spoken records in audio files. It covers two parts:
- Part I: Feature extraction and preprocessing, including the computation of deltas, Shifted Delta Cepstrum (SDC), Voice Activity Detection (VAD), and Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization (CMVN).
- Part II: Implementing neural network models like MLP and KNN for language classification.

### Installation

To set up the environment for Lab 2, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AcaAac/Spoken-Language-Processing--IST.git

# Navigate to the Lab 2 directory
cd Spoken-Language-Processing--IST/Lab_2

# Unzip the submitted code
unzip g09_96138_93179 (2).zip

# Install necessary dependencies (if any)
# Example: pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### Usage
```
# Navigate to the directory containing the code
cd Spoken-Language-Processing--IST/Lab_2/g09_96138_93179

```
## Lab 3: Conversational System

### Description

This lab involves the development of a conversational question-answering system. It covers:
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Natural Language Generation (NLG) using large language models (LLMs)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Implementing a conversational system using prompts and reinforcement learning with human feedback.

### Installation
